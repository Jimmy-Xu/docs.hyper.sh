`Last updated on:  April 4th, 2016`

## Your Agreement with Hyper

- `1.1` Your use of the Hyper service is governed by this agreement (the “Terms”). “Hyper” means HyperHQ, Inc., located at 25 Broadway, 9th Floor, New York, 10004, United States, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Hyper Service. The “Hyper Services” means the services Hyper makes available through this website, including this website, the Hyper cloud computing service, the Hyper API, the Hyper Add-ons, the Hyper Components, and any other software or services offered by Hyper in connection to any of those.

- `1.2` In order to use the Hyper Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Hyper Services. You understand and agree that Hyper will treat your use of the Hyper Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

- `1.3` You may not use the Hyper Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Hyper Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Hyper Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Hyper Services are not intended for children under 13.

- `1.4` You agree your purchases of Hyper Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Hyper or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.

## Your Account and Use of the Hyper Services
- `2.1` You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Hyper Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords, credentials and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Hyper immediately.

- `2.2` Your use of the Hyper Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.

- `2.3` You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Hyper Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Hyper in connection with the Hyper Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Hyper, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Hyper Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).

- `2.4` Your account has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as further explained in the [Quota & Limits](./quota_and_limits.md). The Hyper Services does not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. Hyper reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion. Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.

- `2.5` You may use the Hyper Services only to develop and run applications on the Hyper infrastructure. You may not access the Hyper Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Hyper or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Hyper Services.

## Service Policies and Privacy
- `3.1` You agree to comply with the Hyper Acceptable Use Policy (the “Acceptable Use Policy”) which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.

- `3.2` The Hyper Services shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Hyper Services available at privacy policy. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Hyper’s privacy policies.

- `3.3` You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users of your application. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for End Users. If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to Hyper.

## Fees for Use of the Hyper Services

- `4.1` Subject to the Terms, the Hyper Services is provided to you without charge up to certain limits. Usage over this limit requires your purchase of additional resources or services. The pricing for additional resources and services can be found at https://hyper.sh/pricing (or such URL as Hyper may provide).

- `4.2` For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in Hyper fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Hyper incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Hyper’s measurements of your use of the Hyper Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Hyper and only in the form of credit for the Hyper Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Hyper to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Hyper may be shared by Hyper with companies who work on Hyper’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Hyper and servicing your account. Hyper may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Hyper shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Hyper reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Hyper Services to you for any late payments.

- `4.3` Hyper may change its fees and payment policies for the Hyper Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL Hyper may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.
 
- `4.4` You may not develop multiple Applications to simulate or act as a single Application or otherwise access the Hyper Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees.

## Content on the Hyper Services and Take Down Obligations
