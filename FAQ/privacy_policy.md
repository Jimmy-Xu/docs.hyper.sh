## Web Site Covered

This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of https://hyper.sh.

## Information Collected

Hyper offers a variety of services that are collectively referred to as the “Services.” Hyper collects information from individuals who visit the Company’s Web site (“Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Services (“Customers”).
When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, Hyper requires you to provide the Company with personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address (“Required Contact Information”). When purchasing the Services, Hyper requires you to provide the Company with financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Services (“Billing Information”). Hyper may also ask you to provide additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry (“Optional Information”). Required Contact Information, Billing Information, and Optional Information are referred to collectively as “Data About Hyper Customers.”

As you navigate the Company’s Web site, Hyper may also collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on the Company’s Web site (such as the Web pages viewed and the links clicked).

## Use of Information Collected

The Company uses Data About Hyper Customers to perform the services requested. For example, if you fill out a “Contact Me” Web form, the Company will use the information provided to contact you about your interest in the Services.
The Company may also use Data About Hyper Customers for marketing purposes. For example, the Company may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding the Company and its partners, such as information about promotions or events.
Hyper uses credit card information solely to check the financial qualifications of prospective Customers and to collect payment for the Services.

Hyper uses Web Site Navigational Information to operate and improve the Company’s Web site. The Company may also use Web Site Navigational Information alone or in combination with Data About Hyper Customers to provide personalized information about the Company.


## Web Site Navigational Information

Hyper uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web site (“Web Site Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information that may be collected on the Company’s Web site and how this information may be used.

- `4.1` Cookies – Hyper uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web site easy and meaningful. When you visit the Company’s Web site, Hyper’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you. They merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Hyper, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” or a “30 Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company. Hyper uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer.
If you have chosen to identify yourself to Hyper, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services.
Hyper uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web site. When you purchase the Services or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web site, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.
Hyper may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Hyper Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.

- `4.2` Web Beacons – Hyper uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web site and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, Hyper may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of the Company’s Web site. Hyper uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web site and email communications.
Hyper may use information from Web beacons in combination with Data About Hyper Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.

- `4.3` Flash Cookies – Hyper may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit.

Ad networks follow your online activities over time by collecting Web Site Navigational Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies.

# Privacy Policy FAQ

The following are basic questions you may have about our privacy statement. We encourage you to read the detailed statement above for additional details.

## Why is Hyper updating its privacy statement?
We now meet the high standard required by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and have updated our privacy statement to reflect that. We also continue to simplify language and remove jargon, to make our privacy statement easier to understand and read.

## What is the GDPR?
The GDPR is a regulation intended to strengthen and unify data protection for everyone within the European Union (EU). And because we believe that all our customers can benefit from its mandates, we're implementing it globally. The GDPR requires greater openness and transparency from companies on how they collect, store and use personal data, while also imposing tighter limits on the use of personal data. You can learn more [here](https://www.eugdpr.org/).

## How often do you anticipate updating your privacy statement?
We will update our privacy statement as necessary to ensure that our policies are in line with international regulations, our product and business practices.

## Why does Hyper need my information?
Hyper uses the data we collect to provide you the best experience within our services we offer, which includes using data to improve and personalize your experiences.
