# Getting Started

Welcome to Hyper!

Docker has taken the world by storm by making containers easy to use, locally. The path to production has however been dark and full of terrors, until now. We specifically designed Hyper to make running Dockerized applications in production feel like running them where you create them, locally.

To get started, first please follow these steps:

1. [Create an account with Hyper](https://console.hyper.sh/register)
2. [Install the Hyper CLI on your laptop](./install.html)
3. [Generate a Hyper credential and configure the CLI](./generate_api_credential.html)

You’re now ready to follow our step-by-step guide to Hyper!

## Step-by-Step Guide to Hyper

Hyper is built from the ground up to be simple. In the following tutorials we’ll walk you through using Hyper step-by-step. More experienced Docker users may find the pace a little slow, but we’ve chosen a ‘leave no man behind’ approach. If it seems too familiar, feel free to skip ahead.

Throughout we’ll assume that you have some familiarity with running Docker locally. You’ll find that many of the Hyper commands are immediately familiar and that’s by design. As you follow the step-by-step guide we will explain whenever Hyper differs from the standard Docker commands and will also explain the Hyper billing model where necessary.
